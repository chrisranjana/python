This is various python code related to data processing and analysis.

deface.py: this performing defacing of an anatomical image using a 
custom mask developed at UT.  you will need to grab the template
and mask from the data directory and then change the paths to those
images in the code

Custom  Python developers (https://www.chrisranjana.com/pythonmysqlimport.html)

launch.py: this is an experimental front-end for the launch_qsub
function to allow it to be used from the command line.  not well 
tested yet.

launch_qsub.py: code to launch SGE jobs from within python. This is
customized for the TACC system and will require modification to run
on any other system.

run_shell_cmd.py: simple front end to Popen to run shell command
and wait for it to finish

setup_subject.py: a script to perform preprocessing and setup for
a full fMRI study.  this is a recent port of the setup_subject 
script from UCLA, and has not been thoroughly tested yet.
It makes a number of assumptions about the DICOM structure which
are true of GE data but probably will not work without modification
for any other systems.

fsld: this is an R script used by setup_subject.py to perform data
diagnostics, but it could also be used in standalone mode.
